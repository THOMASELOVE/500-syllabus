["course-description.html", "Section 1 Course Description 1.1 Prerequisites 1.2 Everything is on the Web", " Section 1 Course Description PQHS 500 (cross-listed as CRSP 500 and formerly known as EPBI 500) is a one-semester advanced course in modern design and analysis of observational studies, usually in the context of comparative effectiveness research, with a special emphasis on issues that arise in clinical and health services research. An observational study is an empirical investigation of treatments, policies or exposures and the effects that they cause, but it differs from an experiment in that the investigator cannot control the assignment of treatments to subjects. This course is designed to introduce design, data collection and analysis methods appropriate for scientists engaged in observational studies, and will prepare students to design and interpret their own studies, as well as those of others in their field. Technical formalities will be minimized, and the presentations will focus on the practical application of methods and strategies. 1.1 Prerequisites People take this course with a wide range of backgrounds and a common interest in using data effectively in research related to biology or medicine. All CWRU students who feel up to it are welcome, regardless of their field of study or prior experience. Students with a working knowledge of R, multiple regression, and some familiarity with logistic regression, should be well prepared. I strongly encourage people to first complete the PQHS 431-432 sequence, or at least to be substantially familiar with the use of R and R Studio (as well as, ideally, R Markdown) on the coding side, and with multivariate regression modeling and in particular logistic regression on the statistical side. Those who are unsure if they are well prepared for the course should contact the instructor for some advice. 1.2 Everything is on the Web https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-2018 is the place to go for everything related to this course.
