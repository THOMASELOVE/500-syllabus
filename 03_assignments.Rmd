# Assignments

The course requires you to complete four types of "assignments." 

1. Five homework assignments usually require you to do some analyses (using R and R Markdown) on data I will provide to you, clustered in the early part of the course. These are mostly ungraded for correctness, just completion, and give you an opportunity to practice or develop coding skills in a low-stakes environment. The assignments are [posted on the Assignments page](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-2018/tree/master/assignments)

2. In most sessions, we will be reading chapters from Paul Rosenbaum's *Observation and Experiment*. In early sessions, we will be reading several chapters at once (see [the Schedule](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-2018/blob/master/SCHEDULE.md) for up-to-date details.) Beginning with Class 4, though, we will slow the pace to one chapter per class, and when that happens, you will produce an essay of 150-200 words each week in reaction to a prompt related to that week's chapter. These essays will be shared with the rest of the class. The essay prompts (one each for Chapters 7-13) are [posted on the Assignments page](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-2018/tree/master/assignments)

3. **Observational Studies in Action**. During the semester, you will be responsible for presenting the methods and results of an observational study from the literature that uses propensity score methods. The study must be approved before March 1 by Dr. Love. An appropriate study will 

- use (or at least primarily use) methods we will discuss in class (hence the need for Dr. Love's pre-approval)
- be a fully published manuscript, not a work in progress, published since 2010 with a PDF file of the study itself and any appendix materials that can be shared with the class (so journals that are available to all CWRU affiliates are preferable)
- **not** be one that you or your immediate supervisor have been involved in, and not be one that I have been involved in, in any capacity.

To submit a study for approval, send a PDF of the study itself and any appendix materials to Dr. Love in an email entitled "OSIA proposal" and include a brief (100 words is sufficient, in the body of your email) description of why this particular study is of interest to you.

4. A final course project, which you will present to the class in late April. Your project proposal must be approved by March 1.
